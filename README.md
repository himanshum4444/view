This a a updated doc that I am using to learn about the github. I am right now just using github interface to do the things bt as well as I am learning new stuffs like command so that I can use it remotely. Also right now, I don't have access to commands pront and repositories that's why I am not capable of ding stuffs by the system, hence I am using the remote way of using things. Also I am pretty confident that I will use github and latex extensively, so that I can be able to do thing in a proper standered manner and can make proper im-pact on people .
